Possible database structures (information to store):

    Author
        AuthorId
        Name
    
    Location
        LocationId
        QuickName
        Room
        Shelf

    Publisher
        PublisherId
        Name
        Location

    Book
        BookId
        Title        

    Published  - A book may be published more than once, by different publishers (usually in different years?)
        BookId
        PublishedYear
        PublishderId


    BookLocation
        BookId
        LocationId

    Image
        ImageId
        ImageData
        ?Name?



Project Structure:

    Initially start with three layers:

        WPF frontend (V)
            This will be a minimal WPF frontend, delegating where possible to the transformation layer for any complex mapping / transformations

        TransformationLayer (VM)
            Manage the model, performing any translation / additions required in order to support a functional gui

        Service Layer (M)
            Initially this will be implemented as a class library that uses EF to store data.  There is a possibility that this may need to support an alternative
            approach so that the database can be shared and possibly accessed via WCF.

Testing:

    Start with manual testing through the GUI and see how it pans out, at what point does unit-testing start to add benefits.
